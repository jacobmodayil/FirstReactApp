This is a first attempt at building a react app on learning from Stephen Grider's amazing course on React. This is a subset of Youtube and gets relevant videos for search terms that we enter by talking to the Youtube API. 

It has the same layout as Youtube - in the sense that, there is a parent component with search bar, video list, video list items and video details as child compnents. The application makes use of State, Props and Callbacks to communicate between components.
